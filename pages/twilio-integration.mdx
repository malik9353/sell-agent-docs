## Overview

To integrate Twilio with Sell Agent, you'll need three key credentials from your Twilio account:

- **Account SID** - Your unique Twilio account identifier
- **Auth Token** - Your secret authentication token
- **Twilio Phone Number** - The phone number you'll use for calls

## Finding Your Twilio Credentials

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log into Twilio Console">
    Go to [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/) and sign in with your Twilio account credentials.

    If you don't have an account, you can [sign up for a free Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Locate Account SID and Auth Token">
    Once logged in, you'll land on the **Account Dashboard**. Your credentials are displayed on this main page:

    - **Account SID**: Found at the top of the dashboard, labeled "Account SID". It starts with `AC` followed by a string of characters.
    - **Auth Token**: Located right below the Account SID. Click the **"Show"** button (or eye icon) to reveal your Auth Token.

    <Warning>
      **Keep your Auth Token secret!** Never share it publicly or commit it to version control. Treat it like a password.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Your Twilio Phone Number">
    To find your Twilio phone numbers:

    1. In the left sidebar, navigate to **Phone Numbers** → **Manage** → **Active Numbers**
    2. You'll see a list of all phone numbers associated with your account
    3. Copy the phone number you want to use with Sell Agent (in E.164 format, e.g., `+15551234567`)

    <Info>
      If you don't have a phone number yet, click **"Buy a Number"** to purchase one from Twilio.

4. Save the configuration

</Note>

## Troubleshooting

**Authentication Failed?**
- Double-check that you copied the Account SID and Auth Token correctly (no extra spaces)
- Ensure you're using the Auth Token from the correct Twilio project/account
- Verify your Twilio account is active and not suspended

**Phone Number Not Working?**
- Confirm the phone number is in E.164 format (includes country code with `+`)
- Ensure the number has voice capabilities enabled
- Check that the number is not assigned to another service
