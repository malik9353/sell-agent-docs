This guide walks you through how to import a phone number after creating a Twilio SIP Trunk and start using it inside **Sell Agent**.

<Note>
Before importing a phone number, make sure you've created an Elastic SIP Trunk.  
If not, we’ve got you covered 👉 Refer to [Create SIP Trunk](/pages/twilio-sip-trunk) to create the correct one.

## 🖥️ From the Dashboard

1. Navigate to the **Phone** tab in the sidebar.
2. Click on the **Add** button.
3. Enter the following details:
   - **Termination URI**
   - **Phone Number**
   - **SIP Credentials (Username & Password)**

Once the phone number is imported, it will be ready to **receive inbound calls** — as long as you’ve assigned an **inbound agent**. Give it a try by dialing the number!

## ⚙️ From the API

You can also create a phone number programmatically using the **[Create Phone Number API](/api-reference/phone/create)**.

Here are some key points:

- You can assign **inbound** and/or **outbound** agents to the number.
- If you don’t want the number to receive calls (e.g., outbound-only campaigns), you can leave `inboundAgentId` unset.
