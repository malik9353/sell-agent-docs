## Overview
Dynamic variables are a special syntax that allow you to inject data into various parts of the agents for specific call.

They allow you to personalize your agentâ€™s responses while keeping the core conversation flow intact. Theyâ€™re perfect for customizing greetings, referencing specific information, or adapting responses based on context.

## Where to use them?
- prompt
- begin message
- transfer call function
- custom functions

## Test your dynamic variables
Before deploying, test your dynamic variables using the web interface

## ðŸ§  Personalize Agent Speech with Dynamic Variables (Inbound & Outbound)

You can personalize both **outbound** and **inbound** calls by using the `dynamicVariables` field. These variables allow your AI agent to insert custom dataâ€”like the contactâ€™s first nameâ€”directly into its spoken script.

### âœ¨ How it works

If your agent script includes this placeholder:

      ![Agent Script](/images/agent-script.png)

```json
"dynamicVariables": {
  "first_name": "John"
}
```

## Edge Cases
When a dynamic variable is not assigned a value (not passed in at beginning, and not extracted from the call), it will remain unchanged in the output. For example:

- Original prompt: `"Hello {{first_name}}, how can I help you today?"`
- Output when first_name is not set: `"Hello {{first_name}}, how can I help you today?"`

This means missing variables will be visible in their raw form (`{{variable_name}}`) rather than being replaced with an empty string or causing an error.

## How to check if the dynamic variable is not set?
- if you are using equations in conversation flow, you can use the following equation to check: `{{first_name}} contains {{`. This would evaluate to true if itâ€™s not set.
- if you want to check if the dynamic variable is not set in the prompt, you can use the following prompt: `{{first_name}} is not set (have curly braces around it)`.
