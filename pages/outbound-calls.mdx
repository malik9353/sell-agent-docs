Before you begin, ensure you've already purchased and imported phone numbers from Twilio by following the previous setup guides.

## 🔗 Bind Voice Agents

To enable calling, you **must bind a voice agent to the number**.  
Without an assigned agent, the number cannot make or receive calls.

- You can assign different agents for **inbound** and **outbound** calls.
- To disable inbound or outbound:
  - Leave `inboundAgentId` or `outboundAgentId` unset.
  - Example: If you only want to make calls but not receive callbacks, leave `inboundAgentId` unset.

   Once an inbound agent is assigned, inbound calls will begin working automatically.

## ☎️ Make Outbound Call

You can initiate outbound calls using the **__[Create Phone Number API](/api-reference/phone/create)__** or all the parameters you can use.

- `phoneId` : The internal ID of the phone number you imported or purchased and registered in **Sell Agent**.
- `phoneNumber` : The destination number you want to call, in E.164 format (e.g., +12135551234).
- `agentId` : The ID of the AI agent that should handle the call. This is the agent that will speak on the call.
