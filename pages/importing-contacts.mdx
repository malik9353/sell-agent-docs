    3. **Sell Agent** will automatically map the fields based on the headers in your CSV (e.g., **Name**, **Email**, **Phone**).  
       If any header isnâ€™t recognized, youâ€™ll see a warning, and you can manually map it or create a custom field.

       If a column header does not match any existing field, you can create your own custom property.

       To create a custom property:
       - Go to **Settings** on the top right conrner.  
       - Click on **CRM Properties**.  
       - Click on **Add Property** and name your custom field.

    4. Once the custom property is created, go back to the mapping screen.  
       Select the custom property you just created for the unmatched column.  
       After all fields are mapped correctly, click **Next** to proceed.

    5. After mapping, youâ€™ll be taken to a preview screen where you can review the data from your CSV file before final import.  
       This allows you to confirm everything looks correct.

        Once confirmed, the CSV will be imported and your contacts will appear in the **Sell Agent** dashboard.
