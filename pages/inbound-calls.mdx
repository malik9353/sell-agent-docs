## ☎️ Receive Calls

Once you've purchased and imported Twilio phone numbers into **Sell Agent**, you can start receiving inbound calls by assigning an **inbound agent** to the number.

## 🔗 Bind Voice Agents

To enable inbound calling, you **must bind a voice agent to the number**.

- You can assign **separate agents** for **inbound** and **outbound** calls.
- If you only want to make outbound calls and avoid callbacks, simply leave `inboundAgentId` unset.
- Likewise, to disable outbound calls, leave `outboundAgentId` unset.

✅ Once you bind an agent for **inbound**, your number will immediately begin receiving inbound calls.

## 📥 Inbound Call Webhook

In many cases, you may want to dynamically:

- Use **different agents** to handle inbound calls.
- Inject **dynamic variables** into the conversation (e.g., caller name, business name).
- Pass other context-specific data.

To support this, **Sell Agent** allows you to configure an **Inbound Call Webhook**. This webhook is triggered **when an inbound call is received**, giving you a chance to:

### 🛠️ Option 1: Programmatically

Set the webhook when creating or updating the agent — to review all available agent parameters, check the **__[Update Agent API](/api-reference/agent/update)__**.

```json
"webhookURL": "https://example.com/webhook"
```

### ⚙️ Option 2: Through Agent Settings UI
You can also configure the webhook directly in the dashboard under Agent Settings:

      ![Agent Webhook](/images/agent-webhook.png)

- Return a specific `agentId`
- Provide `dynamicVariables`
- Set the `language`, `voice`, or other options dynamically

### 🛠️ Example Webhook Response

Your webhook should return a JSON response like this:

```json
{
  "agentId": "agent_abc123",
  "dynamicVariables": {
    "first_name": "Alex",
    "company": "Mint Cafe"
  },
  "language": "en",
  "voice": "Emily"
}
