## 👋 Welcome to the Sell Agent API Documentation

This API enables seamless integration with your **Voice-Based AI Agents** and **Telephony System**. Whether you're building a custom interface, automating call flows, or managing agent configurations programmatically — this API gives you complete control.


## 🔐 Getting Started with Authentication

To begin using the API, you’ll need an **API Key** for secure access.  
All endpoints require the `x-api-key` header for authentication.
